# Ethereum Price Prediction using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to predict the price of Ethereum (ETH) over the next week using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

## Overview

The code utilizes historical price data fetched from the Coingecko API and applies a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model to capture the underlying states of the market. The model is then used to simulate future price changes and provide a prediction for the next week.

## Key Features

- Fetching historical price data for Ethereum (ETH)
- Visualizing price trends
- Preprocessing data by calculating logarithmic returns
- Training a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model
- Simulating future price changes
- Converting log returns to price levels

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- requests
- hmmlearn

## Usage

Simply run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and view the predictions.
